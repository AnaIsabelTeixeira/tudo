        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:50, 19/06/2022]</span>  i guess conversations <img src="img/textimg2.png"> are spontaneous, right?</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:50, 19/06/2022]</span>  conversations are really cool collaborations, yes they are</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:51, 19/06/2022]</span>  i mean you don’t know, if you say hello to someone. they may say hello back or not or just put a boiled egg <img src="img/textimg1.png"> in their mouth and walk away</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:51, 19/06/2022]</span>  or something else</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:51, 19/06/2022]</span>  you have no idea</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:51, 19/06/2022]</span>  no anything could happen</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:51, 19/06/2022]</span>  yes</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:51, 19/06/2022]</span>  they could rip out of their skin suit and show you their true <img src="img/textimg3.png"> lizard form because hello was the magic word that makes their skin suit come off</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:52, 19/06/2022]</span>  it might just be or they might have a duck <img src="img/textimg4.png"> in their backpack, which they will take out and it will say hello back to you</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:53, 19/06/2022]</span>  oh that would be very surprising maybe that should be the expectation every time</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:53, 19/06/2022]</span>  it would</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:53, 19/06/2022]</span>  i sure hope that would happen some day</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:53, 19/06/2022]</span>  yes that would be wonderful. you could then give the duck a flower <img src="img/textimg6.png"> and it could put it on its hat <img src="img/textimg5.png"></p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:54, 19/06/2022]</span>  the hat which it has. i like that.</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:54, 19/06/2022]</span>  oh sure it does, I think it wouldn’t like to got out without</p>
        <p class = "txt2"><span>[14:55, 19/06/2022]</span>  absolutely not, that’d be <a href="../index.html">preposterous</a></p>

      <p class="txt1"id="p3">[14:29, 09/04/2022] most actions maybe maybe not maybe that’s a bit silly to say but in a way</p>

      <p class="txt1" id="p5">[14:30, 09/04/2022] without a shopping list of course</p>
      <p class="txt1" id="p6">[14:30, 09/04/2022] but also you go to the supermarket with the intention of buying something usually</p>
      <p class="txt1" id="p7">[14:30, 09/04/2022] yes that’s true an action without any previous intention at all is something to think about</p>
      <p class="txt1" id="p8">[14:30, 09/04/2022] yes</p>
      <p class="txt1" id="p9">[14:31, 09/04/2022] i don’t know what it looks like</p>
      <p class="txt1" id="p10">[14:32, 09/04/2022] also I am thinking about the influence the place you work in has</p>
      <p class="txt1" id="p11">[14:33, 09/04/2022] but maybe to perform without intention you can’t see or hear right? or feel, with large mittens</p>
      <p class="txt1" id="p12">[14:33, 09/04/2022] also interesting</p>
      <p class="txt1" id="p13">[14:33, 09/04/2022] yes so it’s just in the moment</p>

    [16:31, 01/04/2022] the pigeons were not the birds I wanted to feed there but here they are 
    [16:31, 01/04/2022] oh that’s how pigeons work yes they truly come when no one calls 
    [16:31, 01/04/2022] they sure do and when they are there once they will always come back</p>
